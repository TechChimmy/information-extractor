The sad part is, they don’t get enough food to\neat .And this is because only the parents work hard to feed the children in the house. Auvailability of job\nis very less in the village. They don’t have even a proper house to stay. Their house is made up of mud\nand dry straw which very often collapses during rainy season. The parents also rear cattle of the village\nwhen they don’t get any work to do. In return of their service they are being provided with some rice,\ncereal and sometimes a very less amount of money which is quite insufficient to feed the family . Still\nthen their condition is the same rather it is getting worse day by day.

As the family is rather poor, they are not able to\nprovide him with proper medication. Alika’s father is a seasonal grass cutter and collects bamboo from the forest\nto sell in the market. The amount he gets is very meager but there is no other option for additional income. The\nmother is a housewife having no source of income. Providing the children a good education is a dream for them.\nConsidering these aspects, Alika Majhi was admitted in the program.\n%\\. L \"Eﬁ N\nDate P OCT 20n Manager",
